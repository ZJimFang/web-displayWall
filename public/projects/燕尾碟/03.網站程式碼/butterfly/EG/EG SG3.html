            <p>Alec的逐夢之路可說是崎嶇難行，離鄉背井來到洛杉磯發展的他，以為會是一帆風順，終於可以開始唱自己的歌，但如同歌曲中所說的，他被自己信任的唱片公司單方面解約，頓時沒有任何經濟來源，他貢獻出自己的夢想給予唱片公司，結果這世界卻像惡魔一般，將他的夢想吃掉了。這讓Alec不得不回到位於亞利桑納州的家中。「我很感謝我的家人對我不離不棄，當時是窮到連三明治都買不起，之前的錄製的歌曲版權又都在唱片公司手裡，真的絕望透了。」此時的他也才明白，原來自己一直追尋的希望和幸福就在他身邊。</p>

            <h2>歌詞</h2>
            <p>Well, I shook hands with the devil</p>
            <p>Down on the south side</p>
            <p>And he bought us both a drink</p>
            <p>With a pad and a pencil sat by his side</p>
            <p>I said, "Tell me what you think"</p>
            <p>I've been looking for my savior, looking for my truth</p>
            <p>I even asked my shrink</p>
            <p>He brought me down to his level</p>
            <p>Said, "Son, you're not special</p>
            <p>You won't find him where you think"</p>
            <p>You won't find him down on sunset</p>
            <p>Or at a party in the hills</p>
            <p>At the bottom of the bottle</p>
            <p>Or when you're tripping on some pills</p>
            <p>When they sold you the dream you were just 16</p>
            <p>Packed a bag and ran away</p>
            <p>And it's a crying shame you came all this way</p>
            <p>'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA</p>
            <p>And it's a crying shame you came all this way</p>
            <p>'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA</p>
            <p>Took a sip of his whiskey</p>
            <p>Said, "Now that you're with me</p>
            <p>Well, I think that you should stay"</p>
            <p>Yeah, I know you've been busy</p>
            <p>Searching through the city</p>
            <p>So let me share the way</p>
            <p>I know I'm not your savior</p>
            <p>Know I'm not your truth</p>
            <p>But I think we could be friends</p>
            <p>He said "Come down to my level</p>
            <p>Hang out with the devil</p>
            <p>Let me tell you, in the end</p>
            <p>You won't find him down on sunset</p>
            <p>Or at a party in the hills</p>
            <p>At the bottom of the bottle</p>
            <p>Or when you're tripping on some pills</p>
            <p>When they sold you the dream you were just 16</p>
            <p>Packed a bag and ran away</p>
            <p>And it's a crying shame you came all this way</p>
            <p>'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA</p>
            <p>And it's a crying shame you came all this way</p>
            <p>'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA"</p>
            <p>And that is when I knew that it was time to go home</p>
            <p>And that is when I realized that I was alone</p>
            <p>And all the vibrant colors from the lights fade away</p>
            <p>And I don't care what they say</p>
            <p>You won't find him down on sunset</p>
            <p>Or at a party in the hills</p>
            <p>At the bottom of the bottle</p>
            <p>Or when you're tripping on some pills</p>
            <p>When they sold you the dream you were just 16</p>
            <p>Packed a bag and ran away</p>
            <p>And it's a crying shame you came all this way</p>
            <p>'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA</p>
            <p>I won't find him down on sunset</p>
            <p>Or at a party in the hills</p>
            <p>At the bottom of the bottle</p>
            <p>Or when I'm tripping on some pills</p>
            <p>When they sold me the dream I was just 16</p>
            <p>Packed my bag and ran away</p>
            <p>And it's a crying shame I came all this way</p>
            <p>'Cause I won't find Jesus in LA</p>
            <p>And it's a crying shame I came all this way</p>
            <p>'Cause I won't find Jesus in LA</p>
